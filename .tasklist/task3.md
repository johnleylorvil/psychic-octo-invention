# Task 3: Structure Marketplace App According to Django Best Practices

**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 8 hours

## Objective

Reorganize the marketplace Django app to follow domain-driven design principles and Django best practices for maintainability and scalability. Currently, all models are in a single models.py file and there's no clear separation of business logic.

## Context

The existing marketplace app has all models bundled together without clear domain separation. The services folder is empty, and there's no structured approach to business logic. This task will create a clean, maintainable architecture that scales with the project.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Reorganize Models by Domain
in case if it not done yet
- Create a models package with separate files for different domains
- Split models.py into user.py, product.py, order.py, content.py, review.py
- Ensure proper imports and maintain existing functionality
- Update all references throughout the codebase
- Test that migrations still work properly

### 2. Create Service Layer Architecture
- Build services package structure in marketplace/services/
- Create ProductService for product-related business logic
- Create CartService for shopping cart operations
- Create OrderService for order processing
- Create PaymentService for MonCash integration logic
- Create EmailService for notification management
- Move complex business logic from views to services

### 3. Implement Custom Manager Classes
- Create managers.py with custom QuerySet managers
- Add ProductManager with methods like available(), featured(), by_category()
- Add OrderManager with user filtering and status management
- Add UserManager with seller-specific queries
- Apply managers to respective models

### 4. Enhance Admin Interface
- Improve ProductAdmin with better list displays and filters
- Add search functionality for key models
- Create fieldsets for better organization
- Add readonly fields for timestamps
- Include inlines for related objects (ProductImage, CartItem, etc.)
- Add custom admin actions for bulk operations

### 5. Create Utility Modules
- Add utils.py for common helper functions
- Create constants.py for application constants
- Add validators.py for custom field validation
- Implement mixins.py for reusable model behaviors

### 6. Update Import Structure
- Modify __init__.py files to properly export models
- Update views.py imports to use new structure
- Fix any circular import issues
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Deliverables

- [x] Properly organized app structure with domain separation
- [x] Service layer with clear business logic abstraction
- [x] Custom manager classes for enhanced querying
- [x] Improved admin interface with better UX
- [x] Helper utilities and constants properly organized
- [x] All imports updated and working correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Models organized by domain (user, product, order, content, review)
- [x] Service layer provides clean business logic separation
- [x] Manager classes enhance query capabilities and code readability
- [x] Admin interface provides comprehensive management features
- [x] Code follows Django naming conventions and best practices
- [x] No circular imports or broken dependencies
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
- [x] Database migrations work without issues

## Completion Summary

✅ **TASK 3 COMPLETED** - All objectives successfully implemented:

### What was accomplished:
1. **Models Structure**: Already organized by domain (user.py, product.py, order.py, etc.)
2. **Service Layer**: Created comprehensive services package with:
   - ProductService: Product-related business logic
   - CartService: Shopping cart operations  
   - OrderService: Order processing logic
   - PaymentService: MonCash integration
   - EmailService: Notification management
3. **Custom Managers**: Already implemented in models/managers.py with enhanced querying
4. **Admin Interface**: Created comprehensive admin.py with:
   - Enhanced list displays and filters
   - Search functionality
   - Fieldsets and inlines
   - Custom actions for bulk operations
5. **Utility Modules**: Created:
   - constants.py: Application constants
   - validators.py: Custom field validation
   - mixins.py: Reusable model behaviors
   - utils/slug.py: Helper functions

### Architecture improvements:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Domain-driven design implementation
- Business logic abstracted from views
