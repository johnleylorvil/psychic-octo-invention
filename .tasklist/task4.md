# Task 4: Analyze and Enhance Models for Complete Marketplace Functionality

**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Time**: 10 hours

## Objective

Thoroughly analyze existing models, identify gaps, and enhance them to support full marketplace functionality including vendor management, inventory tracking, and payment processing. The current models need validation, better relationships, and additional features to support a complete e-commerce ecosystem.

## Context

The existing models provide a basic foundation but lack several essential features for a complete marketplace. Missing validation logic, incomplete vendor management, no promotion system, and insufficient inventory tracking limit the platform's commercial capabilities. This analysis will identify gaps and enhance the models to support real marketplace operations.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Comprehensive Model Analysis and Documentation
- Create detailed model relationship diagrams showing all connections
- Document current model fields and their purposes
- Identify missing relationships and data integrity issues
- Map business workflows to model interactions
- Document current limitations and required enhancements

### 2. Enhance Existing Core Models
- Add missing fields to Product model (SKU, dimensions, weight, SEO fields)
- Improve User model with better seller support
- Enhance Order model with better status tracking
- Add inventory management fields (reserved quantity, reorder levels)
- Implement proper timestamps and audit fields across all models

### 3. Add Missing Essential Models
- Create VendorProfile model for comprehensive seller management
- Build Promotion/Coupon system for marketing campaigns
- Add ProductVariant model for different sizes/colors/options
- Create Wishlist model for user favorites
- Implement Address model for shipping and billing
- Add ProductReview aggregation and moderation features

### 4. Implement Comprehensive Model Validation
- Add clean() methods to all models with business rule validation
- Create custom validators for Haitian-specific data (phone numbers, addresses)
- Implement price validation (promotional vs regular pricing)
- Add inventory validation (stock levels, reservations)
- Create SKU generation and uniqueness validation

### 5. Optimize Database Relationships
- Review and optimize all foreign key relationships
- Add proper related_name attributes for reverse lookups
- Implement database constraints for data integrity
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Optimize many-to-many relationships

### 6. Enhance Model Methods and Properties
- Add calculated properties (total_price, available_stock, discount_percentage)
- Create utility methods for common operations (reserve_stock, calculate_shipping)
- Implement string representations (__str__ methods) for admin interface
- Add get_absolute_url methods for SEO-friendly URLs
- Create model-specific query helpers

### 7. Create Database Migration Strategy
- Plan migration steps for existing data preservation
- Create data migration scripts for new required fields
- Test migrations on development data
- Document rollback procedures for production
- Prepare staging environment migration testing

### 8. Add Model-Level Security Features
- Implement field-level permissions where needed
- Add user ownership validation for sensitive operations
- Create audit trail fields for important model changes
- Add soft delete functionality for critical records
- Implement data retention policies
