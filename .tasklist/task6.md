# Task 6: Create Comprehensive Test Suite

**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 14 hours

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive testing strategy covering unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests to ensure reliability and maintainability of the marketplace platform. Currently, the project lacks adequate test coverage, which poses risks for future development and deployment.

## Context

The Af√®panou marketplace needs robust testing to ensure all components work correctly, especially given the complexity of MonCash integration, user authentication, and e-commerce workflows. Without proper testing, bugs can impact real transactions and user experience. A comprehensive test suite will provide confidence in code changes and facilitate continuous integration.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Set Up Testing Framework and Configuration

- Set up test fixtures and sample data
- Configure testing environment variables

### 2. Create Test Data Factories
- Build UserFactory for creating test users with various roles
- Create CategoryFactory for product categorization testing
- Implement ProductFactory with realistic product data
- Build OrderFactory for e-commerce workflow testing

- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 4. Create Unit Tests for Views
- Test all template-based views for correct rendering
- Validate context data passed to templates
- Test permission and authentication requirements
- Verify form handling and validation
- Test AJAX endpoints with various scenarios
- Validate redirect behavior and status codes
- Test error handling for invalid requests

### 5. Build Unit Tests for Forms
- Test form validation with valid and invalid data
- Validate custom clean methods and field validation
- Test form rendering and widget behavior
- Verify error messages are appropriate and in French
- Test form submission with various data combinations
- Validate CSRF protection and security measures
- Test file upload forms if applicable

### 6. Implement Integration Tests
- Test complete user registration and login workflows
- Validate shopping cart functionality from addition to checkout
- Test MonCash payment integration in sandbox mode

- Test search functionality across different scenarios
- Validate seller onboarding and product management workflows
- Test order processing from creation to completion

### 7. Create API Endpoint Tests
- Test all REST API endpoints for correct responses
- Validate JSON response formats and data structure
- Test authentication and permission systems
- Verify CRUD operations for all resources
- Test pagination and filtering functionality
- Validate error responses and status codes
- Test rate limiting if implemented

### 8. Build Performance Tests
- Set up locust for load testing critical endpoints
- Test database query performance with large datasets
- Validate page load times under normal conditions
- Test concurrent user scenarios for cart and checkout
- Monitor memory usage during intensive operations
- Test file upload performance with various sizes
- Validate caching effectiveness

### 9. Create Security Tests
- Test CSRF protection on all forms
- Validate authentication and authorization systems
- Test input sanitization and XSS prevention
- Verify SQL injection protection
- Test file upload security and validation
- Validate session management and timeout
- Test password strength requirements

### 10. Implement Continuous Integration Testing
- Configure GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing
- Set up test coverage reporting and thresholds
- Create test matrix for different Python/Django versions
- Configure database testing with PostgreSQL
- Set up integration with code quality tools
- Create automated testing for pull requests
- Add performance regression testing

### 11. Build Test Documentation and Guidelines
- Create testing guidelines for the development team
- Document test writing standards and conventions
- Provide examples of good test practices
- Create troubleshooting guide for common test issues
- Document test data management procedures
- Add guidelines for mocking external services
- Create test maintenance procedures
