# Task 8: Implement End-to-End Testing Suite

**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 12 hours

## Objective

Create comprehensive end-to-end tests that validate complete user workflows, ensuring the entire marketplace functions correctly from a user's perspective. Currently, there are no end-to-end tests to verify that all components work together seamlessly for real user scenarios.

## Context

While unit and integration tests validate individual components, end-to-end testing is essential for verifying complete user journeys work correctly in a browser environment. This is particularly crucial for e-commerce functionality where payment processing, cart management, and user authentication must work flawlessly together. E2E tests will catch issues that only appear when all systems interact.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Set Up E2E Testing Framework
- Install and configure Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- Set up pytest-selenium for Django integration
- Configure headless browser testing for CI/CD environments
- Create browser fixtures for different testing scenarios
- Set up test data fixtures and database management
- Configure screenshot capture for failed tests

### 2. Create User Authentication Flow Tests
- Test complete user registration workflow from form to email verification
- Validate login process with various scenarios (valid, invalid, locked accounts)
- Test password reset functionality end-to-end
- Verify logout process and session cleanup
- Test seller application and approval workflow
- Validate social authentication if implemented

### 3. Build Product Browsing and Search Tests
- Test homepage navigation to product categories
- Validate product search functionality with various queries
- Test category filtering and sorting options
- Verify product detail page functionality and navigation
- Test product image gallery and zoom features
- Validate breadcrumb navigation throughout browsing

### 4. Implement Shopping Cart Workflow Tests
- Test adding products to cart from different pages
- Validate cart quantity updates and item removal
- Test cart persistence across browser sessions
- Verify cart total calculations with various scenarios
- Test cart behavior with out-of-stock items
- Validate cart synchronization for logged-in users

### 5. Create Complete Checkout Process Tests
- Test full checkout workflow from cart to order confirmation
- Validate shipping address form completion and validation
- Test payment method selection and MonCash integration
- Verify order summary accuracy before payment
- Test order confirmation and email notification
- Validate order history display in user account

### 6. Build Seller Dashboard Tests
- Test seller registration and profile setup
- Validate product creation and editing workflows
- Test bulk product operations and inventory management
- Verify order processing and fulfillment workflows
- Test seller analytics and reporting features
- Validate seller profile and store customization

### 7. Implement Payment Integration Tests
- Test MonCash payment flow in sandbox environment
- Validate payment confirmation and callback handling
- Test payment failure scenarios and error handling
- Verify payment status updates and notifications
- Test refund processing if implemented
- Validate payment history and invoice generation

### 8. Create Cross-Browser Compatibility Tests
- Test critical workflows in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Validate mobile browser functionality on different devices
- Test responsive design across various screen sizes
- Verify touch interactions work correctly on mobile
- Test keyboard navigation accessibility
- Validate performance across different browsers

### 9. Build Performance and Load Testing
- Set up Locust for load testing critical user flows
- Test concurrent user scenarios for shopping and checkout
- Validate system performance under normal load conditions
- Test database performance with realistic data volumes
- Monitor memory usage during intensive operations
- Test file upload performance with various file sizes

### 10. Implement Visual Regression Testing
- Set up automated screenshot comparison testing
- Create baseline images for all major pages
- Test visual consistency across browser updates
- Validate responsive design breakpoints visually
- Test theme and styling changes impact
- Monitor for unintended visual changes

### 11. Create Accessibility Testing
- Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
- Validate screen reader compatibility with key workflows
- Test color contrast and visual accessibility
- Verify ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Test form accessibility and error announcements
- Validate focus management in modals and dynamic content

### 12. Set Up Continuous Integration for E2E Tests
- Configure automated E2E testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Set up parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Create test result reporting and failure notifications
- Configure test retry logic for flaky tests
- Set up test environment provisioning and cleanup
- Create performance regression monitoring
