# Task 9: Complete Frontend Implementation

**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 20 hours

## Objective

Implement a modern, responsive, and interactive frontend that provides an excellent user experience while maintaining the Haitian cultural identity and supporting the marketplace's business objectives. The existing template file system structure exists but requires complete recoding of all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

## Context

The current template structure in the `templates/` directory exists with the following organization, but all content within these files needs to be completely rewritten:

```
templates/
├── base/
│   ├── base.html              # Master template
│   ├── header.html            # Global navigation
│   ├── footer.html            # Global footer
│   ├── messages.html          # Flash messages
│   └── meta.html              # SEO meta tags
├── components/                 # Reusable components
│   ├── product_card.html      # Product display card
│   ├── category_nav.html      # Category navigation
│   ├── search_bar.html        # Search functionality
│   ├── cart_summary.html      # Cart widget
│   ├── pagination.html        # Pagination component
│   └── rating_stars.html      # Rating display
├── pages/                     # Full page templates
│   ├── home.html             # Homepage
│   ├── category_list.html    # Category listing
│   ├── product_detail.html   # Product page
│   ├── search_results.html   # Search results
│   ├── cart.html            # Shopping cart
│   └── checkout.html        # Checkout process
├── account/                   # User account templates
│   ├── login.html
│   ├── register.html
│   ├── profile.html
│   └── order_history.html
├── seller/                    # Seller dashboard
│   ├── dashboard.html
│   ├── products.html
│   ├── orders.html
│   └── analytics.html
└── emails/                    # Email templates
    ├── order_confirmation.html
    ├── shipping_notification.html
    └── welcome.html
```

The static files directory structure requires complete SCSS architecture implementation with this import structure:

```scss
// static/scss/main.scss
@import 'abstracts/variables';
@import 'abstracts/functions';
@import 'abstracts/mixins';

@import 'base/reset';
@import 'base/typography';
@import 'base/utilities';

@import 'layout/header';
@import 'layout/footer';
@import 'layout/grid';

@import 'components/buttons';
@import 'components/cards';
@import 'components/forms';
@import 'components/modals';
@import 'components/carousel';
@import 'components/product-gallery';

@import 'pages/home';
@import 'pages/product-detail';
@import 'pages/category';
@import 'pages/checkout';
```

The JavaScript structure requires complete component-based architecture:

```
static/js/
├── main.js                    # Application initialization
├── components/
│   ├── carousel.js           # Hero carousel functionality
│   ├── product-gallery.js    # Image gallery with zoom
│   ├── cart.js              # Shopping cart management
│   ├── search.js            # Search and autocomplete
│   ├── filters.js           # Product filtering
│   ├── modal.js             # Modal system
│   ├── form-validation.js   # Form validation
│   └── notifications.js     # Toast notifications
├── utils/
│   ├── api.js               # API communication
│   ├── storage.js           # Local storage management
│   └── helpers.js           # Utility functions
└── vendor/                  # Third-party libraries
    └── (external libraries if needed)
```

All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation must be built from scratch to create a modern, accessible, and performant marketplace experience that reflects Afèpanou's brand identity and serves the Haitian market effectively.

## Visual Identity and Color Specifications

The frontend must implement Afèpanou's distinctive orange-based color palette that represents warmth, energy, and economic growth:

- **Primary Orange**: #E67E22 - Main brand color for buttons, links, and key elements
- **Dark Orange**: #D35400 - Used for hover states and emphasis
- **Light Orange**: #F39C12 - Used for highlights and accent elements
- **Orange Pale**: #FDF2E9 - Used for subtle backgrounds and sections

- **Warning Yellow**: #F39C12 - For alerts and important notifications
- **Danger Red**: #E74C3C - For errors and critical actions
- **Info Blue**: #3498DB - For informational elements

Neutral colors create balance and readability:
- **Pure White**: #FFFFFF - Main background and card colors
- **Light Gray**: #F8F9FA - Section backgrounds and subtle elements
- **Medium Gray**: #6C757D - Secondary text and borders
- **Dark Gray**: #343A40 - Primary text and headings
- **Pure Black**: #000000 - High contrast elements

## Typography and Visual Hierarchy

The design uses Inter font family for modern, clean readability with specific size scales:
- **Hero Headings**: 48px bold for main page titles
- **Section Headings**: 36px semi-bold for major sections
- **Subsection Titles**: 24px semi-bold for content blocks
